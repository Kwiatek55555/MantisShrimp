        <p class="mantisMain">Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. They have large, complex eyes and are highly colored. </p>
        <article>
            <h2>Attacks</h2>
            <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be 
            <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
            <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey and 
            can cause serious damage to victims larger than themselves. </p>
            <h2>Eyesight</h2>
            <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about
            independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex 
            eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
            <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized 
            light and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum. </p>
